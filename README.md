# Overview
For this project, cohort analysis was used to examine customer retention among an ecommerce store. This was performed by grouping customers by their acquisition date and tracking their monthly purchasing behaviour.

Steps taken:

- Cleaned data in MS SQL by removing null values
- Identified the date in which each customer made their first purchase with the company and developed acquisition cohorts
- Created a cohort index for each order showing the number of months passed since the customer's first purchase
- Imported data in Tableau and visualised findings
